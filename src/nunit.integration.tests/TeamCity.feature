Feature: NUnit should support TeamCity	

Background:
	Given NUnit path is ..\nunit\

@teamcity
Scenario Outline: NUnit sends TeamCity's service messages when I run successful test for NUnit3
	Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>	
	And I have added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests	
	And I have created the folder mocks
	And I have added NUnit framework references to foo.tests
	And I have copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
	And I have compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll	
	And I have added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
	And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
	When I run NUnit console
	Then the exit code should be 0
	And the output should contain TeamCity service messages:

	Given Framework version is <frameworkVersion>	
	And I have added successful method as SuccessfulTest to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests	
	And I have added failedTearDown method as FailedTearDown to the class Foo.Tests.UnitTests1 for foo.tests	
	And I have created the folder mocks
	And I have added NUnit framework references to foo.tests
	And I have copied NUnit framework references to folder mocks
	And I have compiled the assembly foo.tests to file mocks\foo.tests.dll	
	And I have added the assembly mocks\foo.tests.dll to the list of testing assemblies
	And I want to use CmdArguments type of TeamCity integration
	When I run NUnit console
	Then the exit code should be 1
	And the output should contain TeamCity service messages:
